# ROADMAP : KERNEL SPACE/OS Kernel Development

## Topics to be known:

Data Structures & Algorithms (linked lists, trees, queues, graphs)

Operating Systems basics (process management, scheduling, memory management, file systems)

Computer Architecture (CPU, memory hierarchy, interrupts)

## Skills Needed:

Master C programming (pointers, structs, memory management)

Understand system-level programming (bitwise operations, inline assembly)

Learn debugging tools (GDB, Valgrind)


## Learn Linux Internals

Topics:

Linux kernel architecture (processes, kernel modules, VFS, system calls)

Memory management in Linux (paging, virtual memory)

Interrupts and concurrency (spinlocks, semaphores, atomic operations)

Device drivers basics


## Databases 
### Storage Management and File System Architecture
Design and implementation of how data is stored, organized, and retrieved efficiently on disk.

### Transaction Logging and Data Synchronization
Mechanisms to record changes for durability and ensure data consistency during system crashes or failures.

### Page Caching and Memory-Mapped I/O
Techniques to optimize access speed by keeping frequently used data in memory and mapping files directly into process address space.

### Concurrency Control Using Locks and Synchronization Primitives
Managing simultaneous access to shared resources through locking mechanisms like mutexes and semaphores to prevent race conditions.
